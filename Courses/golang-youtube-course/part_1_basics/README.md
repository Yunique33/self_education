# Part 1 - Go Language Basics

This directory contains code written while studying the first part of a long-form
Go YouTube course.

Part 1 covers the foundational layer of Go: from environment setup and the first
program to core language constructs and basic data structures. The material
progresses sequentially and is closely reflected in the folder structure and code.
