# Go - Full YouTube Course

This directory contains code written while studying a long-form Go course
split into three large parts (approximately 12 hours each).

The goal of this course is to build a solid understanding of Go as a language
and to gradually move toward backend development concepts and architecture.

This is a learning workspace, not a polished project.

## Course structure

The course is divided into three major parts, each focusing on a different level
of abstraction and responsibility.

### Part 1 — Language basics
Focus: understanding Go syntax, core language features, and basic program structure.

Topics include:
- environment setup
- basic syntax and program flow
- variables and control structures
- functions and defer
- pointers and structs
- slices, maps, and user input

---

### Part 2 — Concurrency and HTTP
Focus: concurrent programming and network communication.

Topics include:
- interfaces
- error handling and panic
- goroutines and channels
- synchronization primitives
- context
- HTTP fundamentals
- REST API basics

---

### Part 3 — Backend and infrastructure
Focus: building production-oriented backend applications.

Topics include:
- Git fundamentals
- PostgreSQL
- migrations and pagination
- environment variables
- Docker
- system signals
- logging
- Go backend application architecture

## What is stored here

- Code written while watching the course videos
- Examples implemented manually (no copy-paste)
- Small experiments and variations of the presented material
- Incremental changes following the lesson flow

The code reflects the learning process rather than ideal or final solutions.

---

## Organization

Each course part has its own directory and README file.
Inside each part, code is grouped loosely by topic or lesson segment.

The structure may evolve as the course progresses.

## Notes

- This repository is primarily for personal reference
- Explanations and comments are kept minimal and practical
- The focus is on understanding and hands-on practice
