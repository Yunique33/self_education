# Head First Go — Jay McGavren

This directory contains hands-on code written while working through *Head First Go*.

This book is an entry-level introduction to Go.
I use it to slowly walk through the language from zero, translate explanations into runnable code,
and build a clean baseline understanding of syntax, control flow, functions, types, interfaces, and basic concurrency.

The goal here is not speed, but clarity:
to write everything by hand, verify assumptions, and keep simple things simple.

Each chapter is stored in a separate directory and contains runnable code that follows the book’s progression.

This folder is intentionally simple and foundational.
It exists to build and preserve a clean mental model of Go basics.
