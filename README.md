# Engineering Notes & Implementations

This repository is my personal workspace for storing hands-on implementations created while studying technical books, 
courses, and research materials.

Here I keep:
- Code written while reading technical literature
- Exercises and implementations from professional courses
- Small labs, rewrites, and experiments
- Reference implementations for concepts I want to keep “in muscle memory”

The goal is simple:
to convert theory into working code, keep important patterns in practice, and avoid blind spots in fundamental and 
advanced topics.

This repository is not meant to be polished.
It is intentionally practical, iterative, and sometimes rough – it reflects real learning, not prepared examples.
